Hey, my name is Balakumaran Manoharan (Bala). I am a developer and AI/ML Practitioner. 
I completed my Master's degree in Data Science and have worked on machine learning systems.

This is my personal blog where I write about my academic and side projects related to data science.

I love to play Badminton and and follow major [bwf championships](https://www.youtube.com/user/bwf). Lee Chong Wei is my favorite player.
